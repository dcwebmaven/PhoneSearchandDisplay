# PhoneSearchandDisplay
This AJAX project includes an XML document with phonebook-type info and an HTML document that allows a user to search the entries.

The objective/specs for this project were as follows:

Create an XML document to store a phonebook. 
Each entry in the phonebook should include a name, address, phone number and an image. 
This image might be a picture of the person, or it could be something representative of the person. 
For example, if Jane likes butterflies, you might include a picture of a butterfly. 

Next, create an HTML document that uses AJAX to search your XML document. 
All information should be displayed when a match is found, including the image associated with the name.
